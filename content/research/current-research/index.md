## TMB and R-INLA

While I was working to develop methods and code to handle very large geostatistical models, we started studying Tempalte Model Builder (TMB) as a viable alternative to Integrated Nested Laplace Approximations (R-INLA).

In addition to being quite fast and resource efficient, TMB can also be applied to a wider class of problems than R-INLA.

I've taken the time to really dig into the TMB algorithm and have compared it against the methods used in R-INLA. I also ran many many geostatistical simulations to compare the two in a variety of settings.

You can check out a working version of a paper that digs into this on arXiv.
