## Local Burden of Disease, IHME

At IHME, I was the team lead for a small group of statisticians and
computer scientists where we worked to develop and disseminate
scalable models for large geographies and datasets in order to
predict, at high resoluton, disease burden. The main focus of the
Local Burden of Disease team was initially to predict the five leading
causes of child-under-five deaths, but that work was extended to
encompass many other diseases and risk factors. My team produced the
underlying code and models that each applied research team used to
model and predict.

Throughout this five-year project, the LBD team grew to over 70+
members, and we published over data analysts, researchers and faculty
and published over 80 peer-reviewed articles.

In addition to working on the underlying methods, I also worked on a
few applied projects, including [mapping child malnutrition in
Africa](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature25760), and soon-to-be
published paper on mapping anemia severity in women of reproductive
age aross most lower and middle income countries.

Overall, our project and team was quite succesful and our predictions
of burden have been used by international and philanthropic
organizations and countries to assess progress and to set agendas. One
of the honors we recieved was a [World View
Article](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-02386-3), entitled
*Data can help to end malnutrition across Africa*, written by Kofi
Annan, that discussed our work and the utility of data to battle
malnutrition. Serendipitously, this article and our accompanying work
was released on my twenty-ninth birthday!
