My research interests generally related to spatial statistics in a
variety of applications. I started off pursueing environmental and
climatological applications, and then I spent nearly 5 years working
on mapping disease burden. Now I'm interested in combining those two
pieces to think about how our changing climate will be driving changes
in global health.
