This course was taught remotely (covid-19) in an accelerated summer
term. It met MWF, for two hours each morning for synchronous lectures
that were recorded.

Each lecture had a number of exercises which
students could practice on their own, while asking questions to the
group via zoom audio and chat, before submitting answers in realtime
to a poll.

Students were encouraged to use/learn (la)Tex to submit assignments,
and submission templates were made available via overleaf.com

The midterm and final were takehome exams to be completed within 24
and 72 hours, respectively.

Here is the [syllabus](./syllabus_stat394_sum2021.pdf).

You can find [the homework and exams on overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/read/dhyjfpdttrwh). You may request solutions by emailing me.

Here are the [slides](slides).

Here's a [summary of the student evaluations](evaluations.pdf) I recieved from this course.

#### Notes:
* First time using overleaf/latex to encourage students to submit typset work. This seemed to work well.
* First time using piazza for online discussion, I would use it again.
* First time using gradescope for grading, I though it really helped us give consistent marks.
* The accelerated schedule was quite difficult for me and students. I think material this rich is better suited to a more spreadout semester.
