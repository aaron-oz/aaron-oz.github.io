This course was taught remotely (covid-19) and was targetted at
graduate students, predominantly in the social sciences, who were
looking for a voluntary refresher of math and stats. It covered basic
mathematical notation through to basic calculus and linear algebra as
well as reviewing fundamentals of statistics and probability.

Each lecture was recorded ahead of time for students to view asynchronously.

When students submitted the weekly homework assignment, they also
submitted a form indicating which problems they would like other
students to present and which problems they felt able to present. I
matched up presenters with requested problems and at the next
synchronous meeting time students presented problems to each other.

Here is the [syllabus](./syllabus.pdf).

Here are the [slides](slides).

Here's a [summary of the student evaluations](evaluations.pdf) I recieved from this course.

#### Notes:
* First time completely using asynchronously recorded lectures. It worked well for this particular review course but I would be hesitant to record all my lectures ahead of time for more traditional courses.
* I recieved good feedback about having the students present to one another.
