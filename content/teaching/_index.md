I entered my Ph.D. program in 2011 with the intention of becoming a
statistics educator. Over the last 10 years, while enrolled as a
graduate student at the University of Washington and while working as
a Geostatistics Researcher on at IHME, I've continued to seek out
teaching opportunities. Through feedback and practice I've developed a
teaching style that focuses on making statistics hands-on and
encourages peer-to-peer education. You can check out some of my
teaching material by clicking on the links below.
