I'm finishing up my Ph.D. in the Department of Statistics at the
  University of Washington. I entered my doctoral program because I
  enjoy sharing what what I've learned with others and because I
  wanted to pursue a teaching-focused faculty career. At the moment,
  I'm now looking for exactly that sort of job and you should feel
  free to reach out to me if you think I'm a good fit for a job you
  know about. Besides that, I live in Seattle with my wife and son and
  have plenty (too many?) of interests including biking, ultimate
  frisbee, hiking, cooking, building and playing synthesizers, emacs
  and org mode, and reading science fiction.
