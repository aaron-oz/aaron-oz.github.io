I'm finishing up my Ph.D. in the Department of Statistics at the
  University of Washington. I entered my doctoral program because I I
  enjoy sharing what what I've learned with others and because I
  wanted to pursue a faculty career at a teaching-focused institute of
  higher education. At the moment, I'm now looking for exactly that
  sort of job and you should feel free to reach out to me if you think
  I might be a good fit for a position you're looking to fill. Besides
  that, I live in Seattle with my wife and son and have plenty (too
  many?) of interests including biking, ultimate frisbee, hiking,
  cooking, building and playing synthesizers, emacs and org mode, and
  reading science fiction.
