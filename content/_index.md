I'm finishing up my Ph.D. in the Department of Statistics at the
  University of Washington. I live in Seattle with my wife and son and
  have lots of interests including biking, ultimate frisbee, hiking,
  cooking, building and playing synthesizers, emacs and org mode, and
  reading science fiction.
